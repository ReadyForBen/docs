These actions include but are not limited to trolling, disrupting parties, spamming the chat, disrespect, death threats, bypassing, slurs, misogyny, impersonation, and more. When supervising the restaurant, you must administer the appropriate punishments using common sense. Any questions can be directed to Leadership or a member of the Human Resources Department.
