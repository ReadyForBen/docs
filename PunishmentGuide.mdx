### PUNISHMENT COMMENCEMENT:
Greetings, and welcome to the Kousai Punishment Guide. This document will provide the consequences and punishments that you must give to disruptive individuals if they are caught engaging in certain actions. These actions include but are not limited to trolling, disrupting parties, spamming the chat, disrespect, death threats, bypassing, slurs, misogyny, impersonation, and more. When supervising the restaurant, you must administer the appropriate punishments using common sense. Any questions can be directed to Leadership or a member of the Human Resources Department.

### NOTE:
It is mandatory that you type 80% of the individual’s username before submitting a command. This ensures you do not mistakenly use a command on the wrong individual.
