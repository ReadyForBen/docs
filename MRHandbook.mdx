## Code of Conduct

### Confidentiality of MR+ Information
Leaking or revealing any MR+ information (guides, messages, etc) will result in the corresponding punishment. Failure to report leaking will result in a placement under investigation and any other punishments deemed fit.

### Exercising Professionalism at All Times
You are expected to remain professional in-game and in the Discord at all times.

### Use Common Sense at All Times
If something does not seem right, contact a proper authority.

### Remain Observant
You are allowed to investigate small LR and below situations.

### Respect Everyone
You are expected to treat all LRs, MRs, HRs, and SHRs with equal respect. Simping for any higher rank will result in a placement under investigation.

<br />

## Handling Rule Violators
MRs may only kick. MRs may not issue logged warnings, demotions, blacklists, or bans. Always refer to the punishment guide, as it may change!

<br />

## Handling Trollers
When handling trollers, any staff member may issue a verbal warning. If a user needs to be banned for trolling, contact any available HR through the proper channels.

<br />

## Admin Commands (MR only)
Allowed whenever needed (no permission needed):
- !kick (username)
- !logs
- !chatlogs
- !joinlogs
- !bans
- !to (username)
- !bring (username of one person only)
- !view (username)
- !sit (username)
- !uniform (m or f)

Other commands are restricted to HRs.

<br />

## Chain of Command
### In descending order:
- Ryan (Owner)
- Any SHR (President & Vice President)
- Any high-ranked HR (Board of Directors & Executive Director)
- Any low-ranked HR (Executive Assistant & Executive Officer)
- Any high-ranked MR (Assistant Manager & General Manager)

In the case you have to follow this, start from the bottom and work your way up if needed. Avoid contacting developers unless you need to contact Ryan and he is unavailable.

<br />

## Staffing Chain of Command
### In descending order:
- Anyone with Staffing Leadership role
- Anyone with only Staffing role

In the case you have to follow this, start from the bottom and work your way up if needed. This should only be used for pure emergencies or Inactivity Notices.

<br />

## Investigations Branch Chain of Command
### In descending order:
- Investigations Branch Directorate
- Investigations Branch Member

Avoid using this, instead, use the report form for HRs or MRs. If it is extremely urgent, use the chain of command.

<br />

- Lying to an SHR
- False kicks
- Advertising on the group wall (applies to only General Managers+)

Remember, staff blacklists can be appealed through the appeals form!

<br />

## Two-Week Milestone
The two-week milestone is the amount of time an MR cannot resign without receiving a blacklist. Remember, these can be deemed unappealable!

<br />

## Resignations
At any point after the two-week milestone, an MR can resign freely. Simply contact any Staffing HR with your reason for the resignation.

<br />

## Resigned Staff Discord Role
This is a role given to MRs who meet certain criteria:
- You have to have been an MR for at least one month
- You have to be deemed active and helpful in order to receive this role

Staffing leadership may deny an MR this role under certain circumstances.

<br />

## Inactivity Notices
Inactivity notices can be a minimum of three days, and up to two weeks. Simply contact any Staffing HR to start the process.
